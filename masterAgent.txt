    *Make sure to include any tips on trouble shooting

I understood this question to mean how does the Master/Agent Node connection work and how 
do you set up a permanent agent.

Master connects to slave using the standard SSH protocol.

1. Go to Manage Jenkins
2. Go to Manage Nodes 
3. Select New Node 
4. Give it a Name and Select Permanent Agent
5. Hit Okay
6. Launch Method: 
    - Launch Agent Via Java Web Start
7. Disable WorkDIR
8. Select Save
9. Click on the Node
10. Select Launch
