(Side note) Must have a JSON file present for heroku to accept the app as an app.
I don't know PHP honestly, but I found this method and it worked when I recreated it. If I had to explain it I would say the PHP file is simply referencing the home.html so that the app can access it as a route.

1. Create files.

2. push folder to git
	-Git init
	-Git add .
	-Git remote add origin <gitRepoUrl>
	-Git push origin master

3. Push to heroku
	-Heroku create appNameHere
	-Git push heroku master
4. To revert find the git commit ID you want to revert, then type git revert <commit ID>

THIS IS GOING TO OPEN VIM - CHILLLLL

5. Press i

6. Type commit message about reverting commit

7. Hit Esc

8. Type :wq hit enter boom outta vim and you've reverted the commit.
