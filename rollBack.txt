side note, for more practice with git revert i added 
text - reverted that, then reverted the revert.

EXTRA SIDE NOTE - since it's a static html you need to 
trick heroku into thinking it's PHP, heroku only deploys 
APPS. Not static sites. To do so please reference the files
inside of the "basic" directory.

HOW TO ROLL BACK:


1. Add some stuff to the git repo
    - type code
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "adding"
    - git push origin master
    - git push heroku master
2. Boom, change is up there. Live. To revert it go grab 
the commit ID from your github repo. When you got that, go to your
terminal and type the following
    - git revert insertCommitIDHere
3. Proceed to push that to origin master then to heroku master
4. Done
